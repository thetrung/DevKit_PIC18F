DevKit PIC18F/USB-C
=====================
Basic USB-C DevKit I made to learn about PIC18F45XX microcontroller.

![overview](https://github.com/thetrung/DevKit_PIC18F/blob/master/Overview_DevKit_PIC18F.png)

### 1. Basic functionality :
- USB-powered 5V supply.
- USB-HID controllable with PIC18F45k50 with D+/D- pins.
- Reset Button -> Trigger MLCR-pin pull-down -> GND.
- Programming/Debugging with PICKIT-3 via ICSP pins.
- 5 pluggable PORTS : RA, RB, RC, RD, RE.

### 2. TODO :
- Add LCD2004 support, with/without I2C module.
- Add 4x4 12mm-Buttons pad.
- Add 4x4 LEDs grid.
- Add 12V Booster support.
- Add distance sensor.
- Add Gyro sensor.
- Add built-in UART w/ CH340.
- Add WIFI/LoRA/Bluetooth by ESP32 support (?).
